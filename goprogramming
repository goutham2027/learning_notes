cpp smart pointers, java threading for writing concurrent applications

how go language handles concurrency without using threading?
in cpp/java what a thread is? is it binded to a physical  thread, i mean to OS thread.
why templates in cpp and generics in java are termed very important?
go lacks genrics or templates. go is closer in spirit to C than to any other language.
