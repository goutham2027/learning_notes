# Mind Mapping
Notes from publication coach - https://www.publicationcoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/00-MINDMAPPING.pdf

### What is Mind Mapping?
Group of words with circles drawn around them and lines connecting them
to other words.

Mind maps are personal.

### Creating your own Mindmap
Write the central idea in the middle of the paper.

Now let your mind wander.

Capture words or associations that pops into your head. Write them and draw a circle around it. Link it to the word/phrase that inspired the thought by drawing a line to it.

#### Don't judge or evaluate
Every idea is acceptable. Just write them all down on the page. Judging while you are mindmapping will cause you to choke.

#### Don't limit yourself you just the facts
Include feelings, images and metaphors.

#### Don't structure
Don't classify or organize. That's separate wok and it should come later.

#### Don't overthink
It is not necessary to capture the whole idea in a single word. While a mindmap is meant to be succint (brief and clear), it doesn't need to be curt (rudely brief). Do what suits you best.

#### Be creative
Use different coloured pens or pencils. Include drawings or doodles. Your brain likes to be amused, keep it happy while you are working.

### Why do mindmaps work?
Brian left hemishphere and right hemisphere.
|Left Hemisphere|Right Hemisphere|
|------|-------|
|Logical|Emotional|
|Sequential|Simultaneous|
|Responds to detail|Responds to the whole|
|Good with syntax and grammar|Good with images|
|Sees in words|Sees in pictures|

Mindmapping can help you find and use the creative part.

With mindmapping you can take an idea and branch it into many different directions. You don't get confused or muddled up as you might with an outline.

### Advanced Mindmapping techniques

#### Develop your own special shorthand
Special symbols, underline, exclamation, capital letters

#### Use mindmapping for note-taking

#### Instead of just one, do a series of mindmaps

#### Put your mindmap onscreen

#### Use mindmaps for project planning
Minmapping is a fabulous tool for planning all aspects of any project. Because it's not linear, like a to-do list, you'll be less likely to forget something important.

#### Use mindmaps with groups
If you're leading a workshop or strategy session, enhance the group's creativity by putting the notes on a mindmap rather than a traditional flip chart. You'll need bigger paper - and more wall space - byt you'll get better results for your effort.
